<h1>Join a Summer Build for Teenagers</h1>

<blockquote>
The <em>Summer Youth Blitz</em> is a unique service experience for a diverse group of youth, ages 16 to 18, from high schools and youth organizations around the United States. This page will validate as HTML5.
<p>
The Summer Youth Blitz is a unique service experience for a diverse group of youth,<br/>ages 16 to 18, from high schools and youth organizations around the United States.<br/>During this program, 15 to 20 youth participants and adult leaders<br/>"blitz build" an entire Habitat house in two weeks.
</p>
<p>
The house build, an unfamiliar activity for most, provides a common,<br/>nonthreatening ground for building relationships and teams.
</p>
<!--
<p>During the house build, you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Help lay the foundation.</li>
    <li>Assist in framing the home.</li>
    <li>Do simple carpentry, under supervision.</li>
</ul>
-->
<!--Bulleted list removed at the request of supervisor, Jane Doe-->
<p>
In the evenings, the youth participate in activities like team-building games,<br/>leadership development, local cultural events or community dinners.
</p>

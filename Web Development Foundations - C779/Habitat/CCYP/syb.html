<h2>Join a Summer Build for Teenagers</h2> 

<p>
The <em>Summer Youth Blitz</em> is a unique service experience for a diverse group of youth, ages 16 to 18, 
from high schools and youth organizations around the United States.  <br/><br/>During this program, 15 to 20 
youth participants and adult leaders <br/>"blitz build" an entire Habitat house in two weeks.
</p>

<p>
The house build, an unfamiliar activity for most, provides a common, nonthreatening ground for building 
relationships and teams. </p> <!-- During the house build, you will:
<ul>
<li>Help lay the foundation.</li>
<li>Assist in framing the home.</li>
<li>Do simple carpentry, under supervision.</li>
</ul>
-->
<!-- Bulleted list removed at the request of my supervisor, Jane Doe.-->

<p>
In the evenings, the youth participate in activities like team-building games, <br/>leadership development, 
local cultural events or community dinners.
</p>

<h2>Sponsors</h2> 

<p>
This program is sponsored by national grant donations and coordinated by the <u>Campus Chapters and Youth 
Programs</u> department of Habitat for Humanity International. For the past several years, funding has allowed 
for three blitz builds per summer--two in the United States and one outside the country. The builds take 
place during the months of June, July and August.
